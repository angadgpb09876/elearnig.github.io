                <p class="text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge.
                     It also means helping people to learn how to do things
                    and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information.
                    Education needs research to find out how to make it better.[1][2]
                   
                   Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation.
                    This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.
                   
                   
                 Learning in a library
                   Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups
                    can do things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated</p>

            Societies with high rates of education completion have lower crime, better overall health,

    <p class="SectionTag text-big">Entertainment-Education-</p>
    <p class="SectionSubTag text-small">  Entertainment-Education is defined as: "a theory-based communication process 
        for purposefully embedding educational and social issues in the creation, production, 
        processing and dissemination process of an entertainment program, in order to achieve desired individual, 
        community, institutional, and societal changes among the intended media user population.<br>
        This is a communication strategy that aims to alleviate a social issue or educate the public through a custom-tailored piece of entertainment. 
        It is defined by a set of techniques and methodologies which all 
        aim to use various levels of mass media to communicate social and behavior change.
        On the impact-entertainment spectrum, EE is balanced between social impact entertainment (SIE) and social and behavior change communication (SBCC). 
        The primary distinction that can be drawn to SIE is that in Entertainment-Education, the "impact issue" usually comes first; 
        the characters and story are built around the issue. In SIE, the story usually originates projects, 
        and impact issues are woven into or extracted out of an existing narrative.</p>

        Find your learning style-</p>
    <p class="SectionSubTag text-small">Whether you are in junior high or college, 
        you might be looking for ways to make learning more enjoyable.
        At times it can feel like your entire life revolves around classes and studying. 
        If you are able to find your best learning style, you can make this experience more enjoyable.<br>
        Everyone learns differently. Some people are visual learners, which means they learn best with images.<br>
        If you think you are a visual learner, try to use that to your advantage. For example, in History class, 
        rely heavily on the maps and timelines to help you retain and enjoy the information.<br>
        You might be an aural learner. Do you enjoy listening to music and hearing people talk? 
        Try setting the poems in your English class to a beat.<br>
        If you are a verbal learner, you enjoy speaking out loud. <br>
        Try practicing your Latin vocabulary by quizzing a friend</p>
